# How to create a repository file on GitHub 

Log into your Git account. Go to Homepage (the cute kitten head). There you will see a + button at the top right menue. Chlick there and choose "New repository". 

In the new opened window write the name of the new repository, eg "erica kirk campaign" 

<!-- yall this will be on my portfolio? i should sound serious wtf is erica kirk   -->

Initialize with the README.md file and click Create. Now your file is ready to be pushed like a pull door. To do that you need TERMINAL (Ill assume u have mac). Follow the next steps voshm.
> 
- Open terminal
- write down the following code `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname` (for my case it will be `https://github.com/kamilaharutyunyan/erica.kirk.campaign`)
- press enter (your computer is going to clone what you created)
